	<h1>What is a League?</h1>
	<p><span class="lemph">Leagues</span> are opt-in events where players play multiple matches over time, earning points and climbing the rankings to earn digital prizes. </p>
	<div class="helpimg">
		<img src="images/help/league-standings.jpg" alt=""/>
		<span>Some players ranked in a past League ran by the <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/leagues.html" target="_blank">Player's Council</a>.</span>
	</div>
	<p>Each win you earn in a League will get you 2 points, and each loss will get you 1 point.  Your ranking is based on your total points earned compared to other participants.  Tiebreakers are determined by Strength of Schedule, which is shown as "Opponent Win %": basically, players who had strong opponents have a high SoS, and players who played weak opponents have a low SoS.</p>
	<p>Players may use different decks in different matches, or may edit the same deck between matches.</p>
	<p><span class="lemph">Constructed Leagues</span> are events where players use decks that they have constructed from all cards, limited only by the format used by the League.  These leagues are essentially like casual matches, but tracked for point purposes.</p>
	<p><span class="lemph">Sealed Leagues</span> on the other hand issue digital sealed product, which players open to get cards to construct decks with.  Product will typically mimic the <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring/Product" target="_blank">actual physical product</a> the game was originally released in: Starter Packs, Booster Packs, and so on.  If you join a Sealed League late, don't worry!  You will get all of the product from each previous Serie all at once.</p>
	<p>Each League is made up of multiple <span class="lemph">Serie</span>; how many depends on how long the event will run.  New Series will usually represent an advancement or progression in the League's focus: a new set might be added to the format definition, or additional product might be opened.  A single Serie will last a specific amount of time (usually 7 days, but sometimes shorter or longer), and during that period you will be limited to playing a certain number of games in that League.  The specific details are available on the Events tab under that League's description.</p>

	<h1 id="sealed">How do I make a Sealed deck?</h2>

		<div class="helpimg">
			<img src="images/help/league-4.jpg" alt=""/>
		</div>

		<div class="helpimg">
			<img src="images/help/league-5.jpg" alt=""/>
		</div>
		and then change the "All cards" dropdown to the name of the sealed league, and you'll be presented with all of your packs; click on any pack to rip it open!

		</div>

	<h1 id="gold">What is Gold for?</h2>
	<p>
		Gold is a digital currency you earn every week that you log in.  Some Leagues have a gold cost to enter; this is to prevent people from easily entering with multiple sock-puppet accounts.
	</p>
	
	<h1 id="prizes">What are the Prizes?</h2>
	<p>
		Prizes in a league are virtual card variants which you can use while building any future decks.  You can view and open your prizes in the deckbuilder by changing the All Cards dropdown to My Cards and then adding those cards to decks as normal.
	</p>

	<h1 id="cheating">Cheating</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Cheating will not be tolerated</b> - period.  We're all here to have a fun time, and people attempting to be petty for the sake of a few fake league points is beyond pathetic.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cheating includes, but is not limited to:
		<ol>
			<li>Entering any League with more than one account.</li>
			<li>Scumming a Sealed League by entering with multiple accounts and re-rolling your opening packs over and over until you get something good.</li>
			<li>Knowingly exploiting a system or a card bug.</li>
			<li>Game fixing (deciding the outcome of a rated game in other way than playing it out) with other players.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>Players found cheating (or believed to be - at the administrator/moderator discretion) will be removed from the League and their accounts may be deleted. This is a friendly environment, where everyone wants to have some fun, so don't spoil it for others.</p>
