<h1>How can I help?</h1>
<p>You can contribute in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you enjoy playing LotR and have <b style="color:#009f9f">plenty of free time</b>, you may just test and
        report any problems and/or ideas.
    </li>
    <li>Donations? It was a very time consuming project (months), but I love (almost) every moment of doing it. I'm
        hosting the server on Amazon and the hosting costs about $30/month, so I might use some financial help with
        the hosting costs.<br/>
        If you with to donate, here are some ways:<br/>
        - LiberaPay (preferred) - not-for-profit alternative to Patreon, with minimum donation of just $0.01,
        <a href="https://liberapay.com/GempukkuStudio/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a><br/>
        - PayPal - marcins78@gmail.com<br/>
        - Venmo - @Marcin-Sciesinski
    </li>
</ul>
